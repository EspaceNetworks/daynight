"If a selection is made, this timecondition will be associated with the "

"always go to its True destination if the chosen association is to 'Force "
"Time Condition True Destination' and it will always go to its False "

"Destination'. When the associated Call Flow Control Feature code is in its "
"Normal mode (Green/BLF off), then then this Time Condition will operate as "
"normal based on the current time. The Destinations that are part of any "
"Associated Call Flow Control Feature Code will have no affect on where a "
"call will go if passing through this time condition. The only thing that is "
"done when making an association is allowing the override state of a Call "
"Flow Toggle to force this time condition to always follow one of its two "
"destinations when that associated Call Flow Toggle is in its override (Red/"
"BLF on) state."
